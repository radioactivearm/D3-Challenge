This is the Repo for my D3 Homework for U of M bootcamp

# Switching Between Graphs
There are two graphs here. The main assignment graph, and then the more exciting bonus graph.
* To switch between them you comment out the line in the HTML that imports one of them and uncomment out the line that imports the other.


* Line for Main Graph => `<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/app.js"></script>`
* Line for Bonus Graph => `<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/bonus.js"></script>`


## Switching Axes on Main Graph
I ended up making it rather easy to change the variable you can use on the X and Y axes. All is need is to Comment and Uncomment lines of code. Pretty easy.
