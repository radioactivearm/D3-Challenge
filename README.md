# D3-Graphing
The purpose of this project was to hone my skills with d3 by building scatter plots from scratch using d3. I made two different graphs, one that has two axes x,y. And one where with a click of a button you can switch the x or y axis values.

# Switching Between Graphs
There are two graphs here. The main assignment graph, and then the more exciting bonus graph.
* To switch between them you comment out the line in the HTML that imports one of them and uncomment out the line that imports the other.


* Line for Main Graph => `<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/app.js"></script>`
* Line for Bonus Graph => `<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/bonus.js"></script>`


## Switching Axes on Main Graph
I ended up making it rather easy to change the variable you can use on the X and Y axes. All is need is to Comment and Uncomment lines of code. Pretty easy.
